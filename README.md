# Lunar Base 3D-Printing Concept Robot

### TUNSA Space Robotics, TICAD8

**Technologies:** SOLIDWORKS CAD, Unity, C#, Git, Contour Crafting, 3D Printing

## Introduction

This project represents a pioneering effort in the realm of extraterrestrial construction technology. It aimed to design a robot capable of 3D-printing a lunar base using locally sourced materials, thus paving the way for sustainable and cost-effective lunar colonization.

## Project Scope

The project, conducted by TUNSA Space Robotics in preparation for the TICAD8 event, spanned from August 12, 2022, to August 25, 2022, during which a multidisciplinary team collaborated to develop innovative solutions for lunar base construction. Led by Nesrine Abidi, the team explored cutting-edge techniques in robotics, additive manufacturing, and simulation to realize the vision of a self-sustaining lunar habitat.

## Technical Details

- **Robotic Arm Design**: Collaborative effort to design a robotic arm capable of precise extrusion of lunar regolith, ensuring optimal material usage and cost efficiency.
- **Triangular Track Wheels**: Introduction of triangular track wheels for the robot's base, enhancing maneuverability and enabling printing of intricate curved geometries.
- **Contour Crafting Integration**: Implementation of contour crafting technology for automated layering of paste material, improving construction efficiency and structural integrity.
- **Unity Simulation**: Utilization of Unity for simulating the 3D-printing process in a virtual lunar environment, facilitating the identification of design and technological challenges.
